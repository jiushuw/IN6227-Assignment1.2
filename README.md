# IN6227-Assignment1.2
The goal of this work is to make a prediction based on 1994 US Census to predict whether a person's annual income will exceed $50,000. 

In this woek, three different models have been employed for comparison: Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBDT). This report will also discuss the data pre-processing steps, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and provide insights into the performance of these models.
